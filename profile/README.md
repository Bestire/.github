```
o Bestire

  o We build software that developers actually want to use.
  o We're engineers obsessed with developer experience, clean APIs, and shipping things that work.
  o We care about the details others skip.
        o Performance
        o Error messages that help
        o Documentation that doesn't assume you already know everything.
  o Want to contribute? We're always looking for people who care about craft.
  o Most importantly, we hope you enjoy the things we build!
